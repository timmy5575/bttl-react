      <h2>About ME </h2>
  <p>
Iâ€™m a mobile photographer capturing everyday moments with intentionality and
 emotion â€” all through my iPhone. My goal is simple: to create images that are Better Than The Last. 
 I focus on natural light, clean edits, and real storytelling. Each shot is part of my creative journey â€” from portraits
  to nature and street photography. BTTL isnâ€™t just a brand name; itâ€™s a mindset. It means showing up with growth, not perfection, 
  and always finding beauty in the process.
 Every photo I share is a piece of me, evolving one frame at a time.</p><br /><br />
